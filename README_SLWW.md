# Silver Line Worldwide Protocol (SLWW)

SLWW is the core protocol stack developed by Ward & Fine LLC to bridge legally-verified real-world assets (RWAs) with decentralized finance (DeFi) systems. It provides the smart contract, oracle, and registry infrastructure for programmable trust in tokenized assets.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Components

- **SLRegistry** â€“ On-chain registry mapping legal filings (e.g., UCC-1, deeds) to digital asset identifiers
- **SLOracle** â€“ Off-chain oracle nodes verifying lien status, jurisdiction, expiration, and asset class
- **SLBond** â€“ Programmable bond wrappers backed by SLTR treasury reserves
- **SLTR / iSLTR / vSLTR** â€“ Asset-backed token architecture
- **MirrorVault** â€“ Custodial stablecoin mirroring with Fireblocks compatibility

## ðŸ’¼ Use Cases

- RWA-backed lending and collateralization
- DAO-compliant legal verification layers
- Tokenization rails for land, mines, carbon credits, and treasuries
- Infrastructure for custody-integrated smart vaults

## ðŸ“¦ Repository Structure

This repo will include:
- `contracts/`: Solidity smart contracts for SLRegistry, SLBond, SLTR
- `oracle/`: Node/Python scripts for fetching and verifying asset data
- `frontend/`: Explorer UI and wallet verification interface
- `docs/`: Technical specs, IPFS-bound docs, protocol governance models

## ðŸš§ Status

This repository is under **active development** by [Ward & Fine LLC](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wardandfine) on behalf of [Silver Line Worldwide](#).

## ðŸ“„ License
